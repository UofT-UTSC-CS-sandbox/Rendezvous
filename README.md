## Introduction

We are planning to build an app designed to assist people with creating and attending events, with the goal of improving the social life of all our app users by helping them connect with new people and spend time with shared interests and hobbies. Word of mouth is not a reliable and efficient way to plan and host events. Thus, we figured that an online application for doing so would help event hosts fill up their attendee lists and also for students to have a proper portal to browse and attend events that they are interested in. This app can be used to advertise the event hostsâ€™ event, whether it is a professional event or a recreational event. We are planning to start with a web application, and then possibly change it to a mobile app if time permits.

## Highlights

We decided this application was a good idea, first of all, because it caters to a specific need which is hosting events and spreading word about said events. That in itself makes it unique in our eyes, and worth attempting to create. We did not really come up with any alternatives, as we thought of this idea first. We also realized that there might be a considerable risk of meeting possibly dangerous individuals if it was available for anybody. Allowing university personnel acts as a safeguard against strangers. Some connections we build in university could help us throughout our entire lives, and students will need a better platform than existing forums to socialize and connect to each other. It also provides a convenient option for the type of event that people would like to attend eg. professional networking, socializing, etc. all under one umbrella. We organized the team initially using the Piazza post, and then created a Discord group chat to keep in touch with each other. In the Discord chat, we came up with all the specifics, such as the meeting times, sending each other important info like emails, etc. We meet 3 times a week.
