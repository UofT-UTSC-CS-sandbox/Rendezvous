# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME: Rendezvous/Forex4

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to evolve throughout the planning phase of your project.    
 > That is, it makes sense for you commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section).

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build an app designed to assist people with creating and attending events, with the goal of improving the social life of all our app users by helping them connect with new people and spend time with shared interests and hobbies. Word of mouth is not a reliable and efficient way to plan and host events. Thus, we figured that an online application for doing so would help event hosts fill up their attendee lists and also for students to have a proper portal to browse and attend events that they are interested in. This app can be used to advertise the event hosts’ event, whether it is a professional event or a recreational event. We are planning to start with a web application, and then possibly change it to a mobile app if time permits.


#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

Our focus group are students and staff from universities. We want students to have a place where they can meet other people with whom they can interact throughout their time at school while also providing a reliable way for them to receive news for events from clubs and departments. We also want university event hosts to have an easier time making professional events and announcing them, using our application. For example, the LAUNCH event at UTSC
Corresponding personas are visible in the persona.pdf document. 


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Usually, university students rely on flyers and announcements in emails to learn about upcoming events. This can result in an underrepresentation of the number of people attending the event as there isn't a centralized system that disperses information. Most organizations that host events have social media pages on Instagram and students are required to have a social media User in order to access these pages. Moreover, if a user wanted to invite all their friends in one go, they would have to send the post individually or create huge groups. Our web application lets users send event information to their entire friend list without having to waste valuable time. Additionally, it also lets users host events with others willing to collaborate.


#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 
Within the context of this project, for a user story to be “done” means that the feature has been implemented, it has been thoroughly tested and works correctly, and committed to a remote GitHub repository. It requires all group members to agree with the finished product/ feature.

### Highlights

We decided this application was a good idea, first of all, because it caters to a specific need which is hosting events and spreading word about said events. That in itself makes it unique in our eyes, and worth attempting to create. We did not really come up with any alternatives, as we thought of this idea first. We also realized that there might be a considerable risk of meeting possibly dangerous individuals if it was available for anybody. Allowing university personnel acts as a safeguard against strangers. Some connections we build in university could help us throughout our entire lives, and students will need a better platform than existing forums to socialize and connect to each other. It also provides a convenient option for the type of event that people would like to attend eg. professional networking, socializing, etc. all under one umbrella. We organized the team initially using the Piazza post, and then created a Discord group chat to keep in touch with each other. In the Discord chat, we came up with all the specifics, such as the meeting times, sending each other important info like emails, etc. We meet 3 times a week.
