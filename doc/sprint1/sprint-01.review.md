# Rendezvous/Forex4


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect


 * When: June 13th, 2024
 * Where: In Discord Call


## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well


- We figured out a little late about how we were supposed to do the git workflow, developing both frontend and backend for user stories, but it is better late than never.
List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
- Choosing to dockerize the app made it a lot easier to test.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Waiting for the database to be constructed was not the correct decision, as we did not completely understand how development was supposed to work.
- Organizing who would do what, and how was very unclear from the start of the sprint, so we should have planned that out at the start better.


#### Planned changes


List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
- On the first meeting of the sprint, we will all branch from the main branch to make sure we all start from the most updated code.
- At the beginning of the sprint, make sure everyone understands exactly what they are going to do next.
- Make sure the scrum master (Andy) will help with blockers as fast as possible.


## Product - Review


#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:


-Public domain and remote server successfully deployed with docker.
-Simple displays of desired webpages completed


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:


- Backend functionality of webpages not completely finished 


## Meeting Highlights


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:


1) The importance of communication: We did not figure out what was causing us problems until it was too late. Next sprint we will make sure to always emphasize blockers and deal with them as fast as possible.


2) Git Control flow: We did not completely understand how proper conventional git flow was done. Next sprint we will make sure everybody understands how to properly utilize git/github for our purposes, like branching and such.
