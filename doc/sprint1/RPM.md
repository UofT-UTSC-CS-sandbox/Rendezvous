Release goal: 
-social event app where users can sign up and/or host events
-we want the users to also be able to chat with friends on our app
-possibly release the app on the app store
-attempt to collaborate with UTSC (be able to use their email credentials and stuff)
-after course ends, MAYBE get funding from UTSC Hub to try to get students to use this app


Scope of the project
-only for university students and up (social apps for people not of age are not good.)
-that means you have to sign up using a student card or some other identification.
-can organize events, send notifications to those who sign up for it, professional event or not.
-friends list, probably
-we want the users to be able to send friend requests by searching them up in their university database.
-built in messaging is probably an asset
-bio under profile picture
-button for notifying all friends of event
-status for different types of availability for certain events (available for any, available for none, etc)
-segregate the events into each university and personal events
-can append events a user will attend to a list, which may be public or private.


OPTIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES (we can debate if required)
-can request to help host
-for events that just want to meet new people, do first come first serve. This functionality for “meeting new people” meetings may not be necessary.
-possibly have sponsors for events
-hierarchy of friends list, host can decide if “friend of friend” may join


3 cases of events
-professional event, anyone interested may join
-personal event, organizer only invites friends
-personal event, organizer opens it up to anyone interested


NOTE: For personal events, people may choose to chip in for the event. If we think optimistically, we may choose to implement an option for sponsors to sponsor personal events, where the person may advertise the company they have sponsored.
