# Rendezvous/Forex4

(assuming iteration means which sprint we are on)
## Iteration 04 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: August 2nd, 2024
 * Where: Online, on a Discord call

## Process - Reflection

We focused on our individual tasks and each of us informed the discord chat if they were experiencing a significant blocker. There was not much deviation from this process.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
1) Any group member who experienced a blocker immediately notified the rest of the group of their problem, and the issues were always resolved within the day. This made for a very straightforward development process because blockers never lasted for long.
2) We were a lot more comfortable working in a team after 3 sprints, which made communication a lot easier.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
1) The other 3 of us were working on features that depended on 1 specific feature, being able to sign up for events. This meant we kinda all had to wait for that feature to be done. Not really sure how we could have dealt with that better, maybe enforced more strict deadlines on more important features?

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

It's the last sprint, but I guess next time it wouldn't hurt to be more strict about when features should get done.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- <REN-39> and <REN-40>: events a user signed up for shows up on their profile, the 3 most recent ones and when a button is clicked, all attended events, similar to what hosted events has.
- <REN-16>: User is now able to sign up for events, but not their own hosted events.
- <REN-20>: This ticket was kind of associated with <REN-16>, and we decided to forgo the functionality for organizing events.
- <REN-27>: Larger portion of UI overhaul done, specifically the events page.
- <REN-11>: Event suggestions based on user and friend activity done.
- <REN-54>: Most UI/UX bugs fixed, probably.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
- <REN-8>: Not able to see events that friends are attending.
- <REN-18>: This ticket was about including requirements in event description, but we kinda vetoed it.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the future, our main insights are:
1) Inflict more strict deadlines on features that need to be implemented as fast as possible.
2) Continue to value the importance of communication, I guess. A lot of discord messages were sent, and that is the only way we were able to coordinate so well.
