## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 5th, 2024
 * Where: Discord call

## Process - Reflection

We focused on our individual tasks and each of us informed the discord chat if they were experiencing a significant blocker. There was not much deviation from this process.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

1) A day before the due date, we all made sure that our respective tasks were ready for demo and pushed to remote Github repository. This way we could plan ahead for the demo (know what to talk about during demo) and to stay organized.
2) More vocal and active when presented with significant blockers, allowing us to fix them as soon as possible. That way we do not get stuck with blockers when it is too late.
3) Acquired a different 4th teammate, giving us more of a chance to make an app with more functionality.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

1) On one feature branch, one of the files was divided into multiple files for organization, but that made it difficult to merge with main and the other branches, since the file on those other branches was still the same. Next time we will make sure to not make such significant project structure changes unless it can be done cleanly.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
N/A

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

-profile page saves entered data and changes display depending on which user is logged in (<REN-10> and <REN-9> on Jira)
-overall design of each page on the website is a lot better (<REN-29> and subtasks <REN-32>, <REN-34>)
-able to host events, events of which are stored in database but NOT displayed or joinable yet. (<REN-5>)
-able to add friends, but not able to do friend requests yet. 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

-have to display hosted events that are stored in the database, and make it so that users can sign up for those events.
-have to be able to send confirmable friend requests, instead of just adding.
-have to be able to display link to socials on profile, and not just text.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1) Issues should be addressed as soon as possible because they can take up a lot of time and effort if gone unnoticed. This did occur once before the sprint due date.
2) The Jira taskboard should be more specific, as our tasks were only kind of half-finished based on our user story definitions. We must split them up more.
